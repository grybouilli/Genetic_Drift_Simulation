# Genetic_Drift_Simulation
Simulation of genetic drift on elephants and their tusks

This is a little personnal project inspired from a homework we had in biology. The subject was about genetic drift amongst 
elephants. It was observed that a population of elephants which were put in a protected park ended up through generations with no 
tusks, even tho they were not being hunted. 

This projects aims to simulate a population of elephants growing and reproducing through time to see the effects of the genetic 
drift.
